                  Would you like to share your story with me?” The elderly woman
                  in the long yellow dress softly enjoins her companion: a
                  slight man who sits with his head bowed towards his lap. It’s
                  springtime in Zimbabwe’s capital city, Harare, and the
                  setting, a simple wooden bench shaded by wild banana trees,

                  “Whether it’s London, New York or Zimbabwe, everywhere the
                  issues are similar,” Friendship Bench founder, Harare-based
                  psychiatrist Dr Dixon Chibanda tells Positive News. “There are
                  issues related to loneliness, access to care, and to just
                  being able to know that what you’re experiencing – whether you
                  call it stress or depression or anxiety – is treatable.”

                  Were it not for the tragic death of a young woman called Erica
                  the project might never have come to pass. Late one evening in
                  2004, Chibanda received a call from a hospital doctor 100
                  miles south of his clinic in the capital: a 26-year-old who
                  Chibanda had treated at his Harare hospital a few months
                  earlier had attempted suicide. Chibanda talked to the young
                  woman’s mother via telephone and decided that as soon as she
                  was released from hospital, the pair would come to meet him to
                  re-evaluate Erica’s treatment plan. A week passed, and then
                  two more, with no word from the young woman. Finally, Chibanda
                  received a call from her distraught mother. Erica had killed
                  herself three days before.
                </p>

                <p>
                  “Why didn’t you come to Harare?” Chibanda recalls asking .“We
                  had agreed that as soon as she was released, you would come to
                  me…”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We didn’t have the $15 bus fare to travel to Harare,” her
                  mother replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a lightbulb moment for the Zimbabwean hospital
                  psychiatrist, who had assumed that those in need of his help
                  would be able to access care at his city clinic. “I knew then
                  I needed to take psychiatry out of the hospital and into the
                  community,” he explains. Chibanda also needed to achieve this
                  feat in a country with a high level of stigma and superstition
                  around mental ill-health, in which 70 per cent of the
                  population live below the poverty line and where there were
                  just 13 psychiatrists in a nation of 16 million.

                  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than
                  300 million people suffer from depression globally. It is the
                  world’s leading cause of disability and contributes to 800,000
                  suicides per year, the majority in developing countries. In
                  2006, the year the Friendship Bench launched, Zimbabwe’s
                  suicide rate was 20.1 per 100,000 population, twice the
                  international average and one of the world’s worst records in
                  a nation that has suffered a series of population-level
                  traumas: from the five-year Gukurahundi genocide, to an HIV
                  pandemic that saw 25 per cent of the population infected with
                  the virus by 1997, and dictator Robert Mugabe’s 2005 campaign
                  to forcibly clear slums (Operation Murambatsvina – ‘remove the
                  filth’), which left 700,000 Zimbabweans homeless.

                  Elton Mudzingwa, 47, had hit rock bottom when his neighbour
                  suggested he attend grandmother Felistas Gasa’s Friendship
                  Bench in Harare. The street vendor had lost his wife and was
                  struggling to cope with his grief at the same time as raising
                  two sons alone. With his youngest son slipping into street
                  drug addiction, father and son were no longer speaking, and
                  Mudzingwa had begun to drown his sorrows with cheap beer.
                  Mudzingwa arrived at his first session drunk, he admits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “But grandmother was patient enough to speak with me,” he
                  says. “She asked about my state of mind and if I was
                  entertaining any suicidal thoughts.” As Gasa was a friendly
                  neighbourhood face, Mudzingwa felt emboldened to open up. “I
                  felt as if she cared for me, she was not telling me what to do
                  or being judgmental,” he explains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gasa beams. “In the early days [of Friendship Bench], many of
                  the people who came to us were stranded on the streets with
                  their children [due to Operation Murambatsvina],” she says.
                  “My work then and now was about changing lives as much as
                  changing the way people look at their lives: a homeless woman
                  might need advice on how to get funding to start a small
                  business so she can return to her village with her children,
                  for example.” Gasa feels happy when she sees lives change. “I
                  think to myself: what if I had just ignored their story. Where
                  would they be?” she adds.

                  The Friendship Bench method begins with talking therapy. Most
                  of the therapists are older women, who are traditionally
                  turned to for counsel in Zimbabwean culture. The women are
                  trained in the basics of cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]
                  and allocated a park bench in their communities. They are paid
                  a wage by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health [equivalent to a
                  community health worker’s wage], topped up by money fundraised
                  by Friendship Bench. Referrals to the service, which come via
                  primary healthcare, schools and police stations, and more
                  recently self-referrals via social media, are screened via a
                  validated questionnaire that’s couched in Zimbabwean concepts
                  of mental ill-health: the Shona Symptom Questionnaire.
                  Clinical cases, such as those at risk of suicide, are referred
                  to hospital settings, with selected cases going on to receive
                  two to four bench sessions. After these, clients are invited
                  to join a peer support group for those who have received the
                  Friendship Bench therapy (a circle <em>kubatana tose</em> or
                  ‘holding hands together’ group), at which attendees are taught
                  revenue-generating skills, such as making bags out of recycled
                  materials.

                  Grandmother Juliet Kusikwenyu, 70 and based in Mbare [south of
                  Harare], was recruited to the Friendship Bench from her job as
                  a health visitor. It was Dixon Chibanda’s enthusiasm for
                  community based mental healthcare that attracted her.

                  “He said that people are suffering from headaches and other
                  symptoms but that the cause will be depression or stress,”
                  Kusikwenyu says. “This made sense to me, and I wanted to
                  help.”
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Helping people solve their problems brings me so much joy

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Integral to the Friendship Bench method is its articulation
                  through local cultural concepts rather than western medical
                  diagnoses, which can contribute to stigma. “Grandmothers talk
                  in the sessions about <em>kuvhura pfungwa</em>, which is a
                  Shona word for ‘opening up the mind’,” Chibanda explains,
                  “they also talk about <em>kusimudzira</em>, a Shona word for
                  ‘uplifting’ and <em>kusimbisa</em>, which means
                  ‘strengthening’.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed the term ‘Friendship Bench’ was suggested by the
                  project’s founding grandmothers, Chibanda adds. “Initially we
                  called it the Mental Health Bench, but the grandmothers told
                  me no one would want to come to a project with such a
                  stigmatising name,” he says.

                  Kusikwenyu’s most memorable client was a young man called
                  Samson, who came to the bench after finding out he was HIV
                  positive. His diagnosis led to separation from his wife and he
                  was left with three children and his elderly mother who had
                  angrily rejected her son due to his HIV.

                  wife died. With the grandmothers help, he has quit drinking.
                  "I felt as if she cared for me, she was not telling me what to
                  do or being judgemental," he says.

                  “I encouraged Samson and his mother to come to the bench
                  together so they could both accept his [HIV] status,”
                  Kusikwenyu says. “Then I urged him to get treatment for his
                  condition and, when he started taking his medication, we
                  looked at his stresses around providing for his three
                  children.” With the grandmother’s counsel, Samson borrowed
                  seed money to start a vegetable vending business. His business
                  began to grow and today Samson is happily remarried to a woman
                  he met at church who is also living with HIV. Now a tenant
                  farmer, Samson has built a house for his family. “Stories like
                  this bring me so much joy,” says Kusikwenyu. “It gives me the
                  strength to work till I am 80!”

                  In 2016, Chibanda – collaborating with colleagues from
                  Zimbabwe and the UK – published the results of a
                  six-month-long randomised control trial in the Journal of the
                  American Medical Association. They split 600 people with
                  symptoms of depression into two groups and found that the
                  group that saw the grandmothers had significantly lower
                  symptoms of depression compared to the group that had
                  conventional treatment.

                  which found that 67 per cent of women clients in Zimbabwe had
                  maintained or expanded their income-generating projects, and
                  another that found broad benefits in the model for
                  grandmothers’ own mental health. An upcoming study, meanwhile,
                  finds that the Friendship Bench improves the health outcomes
                  of clients with diabetes and hypertension.

                  Lay-delivered mental health programmes such as the Friendship
                  Bench have a range of benefits, says Dr Nilofer Naqvi, an
                  academic psychologist who works in sub-Saharan Africa. They
                  also hold lessons for expanding mental healthcare access to
                  marginalised communities in the global north, including
                  Indigenous peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “With mental health carrying so much cultural belief and
                  stigma, there are also genuine benefits in using
                  interventionists, such as these grandmothers, who have an
                  in-depth local, cultural knowledge and who are part of the
                  community,” she says.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet there are risks, she notes. “[These programmes] can let
                  health systems off the hook from investing in expert mental
                  healthcare.” Naqvi worries about the emergence of a pool of
                  lay mental healthcare providers in the global south “who are
                  not equipped for the burdens they face in an absence of
                  emergency psychiatry settings”, such as dealing with a violent
                  psychotic episode.

                  Chibanda admits that there have been mistakes in translating
                  projects to other contexts. While the Friendship Bench is
                  thriving in Zanzibar, where the national Ministry of Health is
                  scaling the project nationally, and in Vietnam with young
                  people with HIV, a project in Jordan was wound down after
                  government support failed to materialise, and in New York’s
                  Bronx and Harlem after a sympathetic local administration was
                  voted out. “Without local stakeholder buy-in we don’t have
                  sufficient capacity or indeed local knowledge,” he says.
